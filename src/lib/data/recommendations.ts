Jake is a talented developer who is always willing to help others whenever he gets his work done early, which has pleasantly happened numerous times. On top of those qualities, I\'ve always appreciated Jake\'s leadership as well as his undeniably gifted communication/presentation skills in front of clients. You can count on Jake to be a leader, a teacher, and a "do"er. Any organization will be lucky to have someone like Jake on their team!</p>',

    quote: '<p>The biggest compliment I can give Jake is that he is the hardest working, most self motivated developers I\'ve ever lead in my time as a manager. He has one of the key skills a developer needs of always wanting to know more and contribute more. He is truly constantly learning. As a manager, he was never someone that required a lot of hand holding to make sure that he was productive. Basically, he was someone that once he is up to speed you can trust to almost manage himself. Basically, I cannot recommend him enough as just a stellar person to work with and manage.</p>',

I\'ve never met someone who\'s been so committed to helping you solve a problem and subsequently follow up to make sure you\'re taken care of. Jake\'s passion for development and mentoring others on all things technical is very clear, and he never seems to stop learning and pushing his knowledge to the limits. Jake is someone you can count on to get the work done, and get it done well. You will wonder how he\'s able to accomplish so much in the span of a single work day, and come back the next just as energized. Overall, Jake has been a tremendous addition to our development team and any organization would be extremely lucky to have him.</p>',

    quote: '<p>Jake is one of the most capable and helpful developers I’ve had the chance to work with. To our team he acted as a mentor and sounding board, always available even when he had his own work to do. Over the past two years of working with Jake, I’ve seen him tirelessly focus on creating tools and processes that empower the dev team to be more efficient. While Jake was tantamount to making our team more effective, he also helped each and everyone of us grow as developers by encouraging team knowledge share and collaboration. Jake’s the kind of developer that would be a huge asset to any company not only because of his dev chops, but because of his proactive, team-player attitude.</p>',

      <p>I have worked with Jake for four years at Brooks Bell. He's incredibly hardworking - someone you can always count on to get things done and get them done well. He is also constantly looking for inefficiencies and figuring out how to improve them. One example of many is how he revamped and modernized our internal development team's process by creating a build tool that automates repetitive tasks and ensures every developer is working from the same template. During his time at Brooks Bell he has continually added new features to this tool, optimizing our process even further.</p>
      <p>He's the first to volunteer to help a teammate and has spent countless hours assisting me and other members of the team. Even when he's busy with his own work, he's happy to take the time to help troubleshoot a problem, answer a question, look into a bug, or provide ideas for improving a piece of code. I owe a lot of my growth as a developer over the years to his patient explanations and feedback.</p>
      <p>Jake's smart, constantly learning, and the kind of person who you could throw at any problem and he'd figure out a solution. He has contributed hugely to our development team's success over the years, and I'm so sad our team is losing him.</p>`,

I have yet to meet a developer who rivals his raw talent, ability to problem-solve, and drive for success. When there\'s a problem that stumps every other developer, we go to Jake. I\'ll miss having him on our team, and I\'m deeply jealous of whomever gets to work with him next. </p>',

      <p>Jake is the glue that holds our development team together. He's worked tirelessly to create, maintain, and improve a cross-client built tool that allows devs to quickly generate A/B and multi-variant tests. Over my time at Brooks Bell, he's actively solicited feedback from us when we stumble across an edge case or take on a client with special requirements, he's greatly expanded the build tool's functionality, and he's encouraged even the most junior among us to contribute to our internal tools. </p>
      <p>He's the kind of senior dev and mentor you hope you'll have the opportunity to work with: generous, humble, smart, curious, and patient. He personally checks in with all the devs daily, offering support on the spot. Even when he has a lot on his plate, he will clear a slot for you if you need a sounding board or to urgently troubleshoot. Perhaps most significantly, he takes time to truly understand your idea, meaning that you always leave with thoughtful feedback and a roadmap to realizing your goal.</p>
      <p>Upon his promotion to Senior Engineer, Jake made the seamless onboarding of junior devs—and on-going support for their growth—a center piece of his non-client work. He sets a good example and makes everything feel do-able. He takes clarity, modularization, and documentation of code seriously, not simply for reasons of efficiency, but also to keep our shared code base accessible and our work collaborative and (of course) fun!</p>
